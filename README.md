# Single-cell-transcriptomics-neuroblastoma

The present work gravitates around the implementation of an extensible pipeline of single-cell transcriptomics leveraging RNA-seq counts derived from two MYCN-amplified neuroblastoma cell lines called KELLY and SK-N-BE(2)-C. The scope of the study is to determine the transcriptome-wide heterogeneity associating with different mutational backgrounds harboured by distinct model tumoral cells and evaluate the effectiveness and reuse potential of our generated datsets. 

The flowchart articolates in multiple steps:
